Here are some broad policy questions:

1.	Are there specific clinical/situational factors that appear to increase risk of violence? If so, could it be mitigated?
2.	Are there specific healthcare settings that have higher rates of physical violence and/or verbal violence?
3.	Which healthcare professions are most impacted by violence?
4.	Can we assess the scale of physical and emotional impact of violence on healthcare workers by looking at severity of injury or lost days worked?
