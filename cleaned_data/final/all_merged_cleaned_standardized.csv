Then they sent a text asking if I was ""NP"", I said it was. I got 4 back to back texts, it was a patient I saw at Inland, when I did not respond in the 30 seconds after, she called me. I asked her how she got my number as it is my personal cell phone. She said she found it on the internet. I told her she needed to call the office and go through the proper channels as this is inappropriate, she continued complaining of her abdominal pain. I told her I am driving, out of the office, and not near a laptop so I cannot help her. She then told me she had my Manchester address, just wanted me to be aware she said. I told her she needs to call the office. She got mad at me, told me to go back to driving and hung up""

NPs Manchester address is his home address. He further stated that this same patient reached out to him last year via LinkedIn and he told her at that time that it was an inappropriate method of contacting him.

I discussed this with Melissa Audet and she discovered that Steve's personal information is on several non-NLH listed as his work contact information. We made Steve aware of this and he has taken steps to have this information removed where he was able to.
