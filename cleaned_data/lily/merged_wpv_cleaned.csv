When I arrived, the nurse said he was all ready and as I was preparing the stretcher I grabbed his pillow from his room as we usually do to make the patient more comfortable during transport. He attempted to corner me in his room and said something along the lines of, ""What the fuck are you doing with my pillow. You bitch! Don't take my stuff, put that back NOW!"". I explained that I was just trying to make him comfortable and put the pillow back on his bed. I asked if he would like a blanket for transport and he screamed ""fuck no!"". Once we left KPO3 he became agitated and asked me to stop adjusting the stretcher (as in switching from neutral to break, etc.). I explained that I unfortunately need to be able to move the stretcher in different settings to ensure a safe transport. Leaving KPO3 there are hills in the hallway, so I warned him every time I adjusted the petal (ex. you have to break on the hill to open the door) and he'd say, ""fuck you"". When we entered the elevator, the patient started screaming about a poster that said, ""are you feeling overwhelmed? "", The patient said, ""I'm gonna take that fucking shit down, fuck that"". He proceeded to try to get off the stretcher, but didn't have enough room so he sat back down and attempted to rip down the poster from the stretcher. When we reached the 2nd floor, I quickly exited the elevator, so I was not in an enclosed space alone with the patient. The patient kept complaining that it was ""too hot in here"" or ""too cold"" and I said, ""I'm sorry"" and he said, ""oh so this is fucking your fault, fuck you"". When we arrived at the vascular lab, I left him in the designated patient area and notified the secretary that the patient is unpredictable and verbally aggressive. I then immediately went to the materials unit to report the incident to my charge and supervisor. I considered hitting my strong line alert during transport as I felt unsafe. I am a new employee and wasn't sure where the line was in regard to whether to hit it or not. I then immediately began writing this incident report.

He also splashed water at me, and threw a bar of soap. This went on for half hour at least. By noon I was trying to get him into bed and give him the IPAD to use. This was not enough for him, he began crawling over the bed rails and was try to lay on the ground where I had already placed floor mats. He then became irritated further and was lounging at his mother, and myself. He had johnny pants on that were ill fitting on him, and he was semi exposed but that did not appear to bother him.

He threw a soccer ball at my face as well. Soon after the neuro consult came and he became aggressive with him too, I had other staff request a net bed for his protection and while waiting he had continued aggression, and I encouraged his mother to step out and that we would handle it.

I tried to talk to him and de-escalate the situation throughout this and it did not work.

I was able to get, CNA and RN and another RN to come in with me to help attempt to hold patient while I gave the injection. Injection was given and when we tried to close the net bed he kicked CNA's glasses almost off of her face, kicked me causing me to trip and stumble backwards, and was hitting and fighting staff. We dimmed the lights and waited to see if the medication would help, half hour later patient was still screaming and jumping in bed, standing and trying to rip through the netting. at this point, patient called out saying ""I am going to shit my pants"" CNA and I went in to see and he had urinated all over the mattress, his pants were off and he said he needed to poop. I asked CNA and RN to come in with me to help clean the bed and get him to the bathroom, upon opening the net the minute his feet hit the ground he ran at the cna, taking her to the ground, was kicking and hitting, refused to get back into the bed, and saying he did not need to poop. At this point a strongline was called and when security arrived patient was half into the net bed, RN came in and lifted patient's legs so we could get him in while he was kicking her. Patient continued screaming, said ""come here"" I went over and said hey what's going on and he responded by flipping me off and I said it was not very nice and he replied with, ""I don't give a fuck.""

Fear of safety/retaliation. ",  ,"I called an individual this morning (8/22/2024) to remind of upcoming appointment, from there the recipient on other end of the line (Shean Hall) proceeded to verbally harass me. At that point my Clinical Educator, Lauren Crane, stepped in to help with the situation._x000D_
_x000D_
Over the past month this individual has been contacting our Bangor clinics countless times. There has been a history of hostility over the phone. It ended up with the individual having an ""explosive"" phone encounter with me this morning using harsh words, lies, threats, accusations, yelling, and more unstable/unpredictable behavior directed at me. I no more got out the words, ""this is Work Health calling to remind,"" when the individual started to verbally attack me and refer to me by my name although never having met this individual aside from phone conversations pertaining to upcoming appointment. I am scared of this individual knowing my identity. I am really scared of retaliation.      _x000D_
_x000D_
Threats entailed going to my manager and director of operations, threats to sue were made while on call with Clinical Educator, he stated he was furious with me, accused me of lying and speaking with his manager of his department. Said, ""how dare I, and how do you explain yourself,"" and demanded an answer. Stated I was lying and completely wrong with information relayed to him. _x000D_

Supervisor offered to send me home for the day, I did not accept due to needing PTO for holidays. She also stated that if he is onboarded (he will be working within same building as me), that I have to be the one to relocate to a different location. ",Human Resources (HR) & Employee Services,Work Health - State St Bangor,,  ,,,,  ,

He was expressing extreme dissatisfaction with the coordinator, making statements including ""how dare you treat me this way"", ""you have cost me so much money and weeks of work"", ""you have no right to tell me I need a blood draw"", ""I called the other office [union street] and they said you are nuts"", ""you have no right to tell my employer I declined the job, this has set my start date back from weeks"", among various demands to speak to her authority figure. _x000D_
_x000D_
I picked up the phone and calmly identified myself as Lauren the Clinical Educator. Before I could finish speaking the patient said ""oh thank god a higher up"" and proceeded to repeat his complaints without pause for over 5 minutes. He stated he was going to sue, he ""would not let this go"" and ""once I am hired will do everything I can to see that she is terminated or at least completely retrained"". He did not ask any questions of me._x000D_
_x000D_
His speech was rapid and clear. Attempts to re-direct were challenging and mostly unsuccessful. His capacity to process new information was diminished. I asked him what had occurred this morning that upset him - he stated ""she called me, I heard her voice and knew it was her. She has made my life so difficult..."" and he began repeating his complaints. This time he spoke without pause for approximately 5 additional minutes._x000D_
_x000D_
He could not tell me when he first came to Work Health- He did not directly acknowledge the question until the 3rd time I asked. He often provided conflicting details: At one point he told me the State St. clinic was closer to him, then later stated it was farther than the Union St. At one point he told me his needle phobia caused his delay in start date, then exclusively blamed Mikayla's and ""her thinking she just makes all the decisions."". He denied ever declining any position and stated, ""my employer is furious too; they can't believe it.""_x000D_
_x000D_
He did not directly mention any staff by name, referring to Mikayla only as ""that girl"". He did not make threats of bodily harm towards any person or property._x000D_
_x000D_
His perception of my likability changed rapidly and cyclically - one moment he thanked me for being ""so nice and listening to me, you're great"" and in the same sentence said ""but I know you won't do anything and will just throw away the notes you're taking once I hang up.""_x000D_
_x000D_
I offered to change his PPD Read appointment to the Union St clinic. He kindly accepted, then expressed how irritating it was to have to go across town, but ""this should be taken as a sign of how angry I am. I am normally a nice guy.""_x000D_
_x000D_
The patient was speaking slower at the end of the phone call. I double confirmed the details of his upcoming appointment with him. He expressed how he is ""a nice guy but won't let this go. When I am hired I want to speak to the director and I want her [Mikayala] fired or at least re-trained. I don't see how she can keep her job after this."" He expressed a high level of gratitude for myself and all other members of Work Health. He said he was ""not going to let this ruin my day because you know what - she doesn't get to control my day. It's so beautiful out."" I told him we would speak soon._x000D_

I asked for his date of birth to look up appointments he may have.  I asked him to repeat his date of birth to make sure I had right info and he started to yell loudly are you deaf?  I have already told you my date of birth.  He repeated that 3 times very loudly and I told him to stop, I will look up appointment data now.  He pulled out his cell phone and stated he was recording this encounter with Tik Tok right now.  I excused myself and said I would be back and closed my window.  He walked away from my window and I reported to my Manager.  My two co-workers in our PSR office were witnesses and getting upset as well.  This was totally inappropriate and irrational behavior.  As I returned to my desk, this individual had left the waiting area and not in Door 4 area.  Appreciated my Manager, Kerry Spooner her assistance in this incident.",Provider Professional Services,Other/Unknown,,  ,,,,  ,
